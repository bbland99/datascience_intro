Course work !

These notebooks are modified versions of lab assignments from a course I am currently taking (Data Science and Machine Learning in Python). 
Dependent dataset files are located in the repo as well. These notebooks are just to showcase what I am learning in the course, and monitor 
my progress in the field of Data Science.
